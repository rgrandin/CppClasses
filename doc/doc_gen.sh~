# This script builds the documentation for my 'qgenrecon' project.  The name of the active
# branch within the git repository is obtained and used as a subdirectory within the web
# folder containing documentation for 'qgenrecon'.
#
# NOTE: Source code location, along with image location and excluded files/directories,
#	is defined in the doxygen file 'doxyfile.txt'.  This script simply runs DOxygen
#	and copies the result to the appropriate web directory.

# Get name of git branch

# Delete 'html' directory to ensure that the built documentation is current.

# Run DOxygen on copied files.  Documentation is generated in local directory
